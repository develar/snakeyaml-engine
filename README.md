***The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity.***

## Overview ##
[YAML](http://yaml.org) is a data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages.

SnakeYAML engine is a YAML processor for the Java Virtual Machine.

## SnakeYAML engine features ##

* a **complete** [YAML 1.2 processor](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html). In particular, SnakeYAML can parse all examples from the specification.
* Unicode support including UTF-8/UTF-16/UTF-32 input/output.
* Low-level API for serializing and deserializing native Java objects.
* No support for all the [Recommended Schemas](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Schema). Only JSON is supported.
* Relatively sensible error messages (can be switched off to improve performance).
